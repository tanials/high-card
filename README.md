# 🧪 Java Programming Exercise: Refactoring, Security, and New Features

This exercise aims to evaluate your skills in Java development with Spring Boot, focusing on:

- 🔁 Refactoring and code quality
- 🔐 Security and vulnerability management
- ⚙️ Implementation of new features
- 🧪 Writing tests and documentation

---

## 🎯 Goal

The repository contains a simple **Spring Boot** application. Your task is to improve the existing code and add new features, demonstrating proficiency in:

- 🔐 **Security**: Identifying and fixing vulnerabilities.
- ✨ **Code Quality**: Refactoring, exception handling, and documentation.
- 🚀 **Functional Development**: Extending the application with business logic.
- ✅ **Testing**: Validating features through automated tests.

## 📌 Tasks to Complete

1. **🧾 Data Validation**
    - In the user creation service, implement strict validation for the `email` and `phoneNumber` fields.
    - The `phoneNumber` must comply with the **Italian standard** (correct prefix and length).

2. **🛡️ SQL Injection Prevention**
    - The `PUT` endpoint is vulnerable to **SQL Injection**.
    - Identify and fix the vulnerable logic by properly validating inputs.

3. **📊 Pagination, Sorting, and Search**
    - Complete the user search method:
        - Return a paginated list after input validation.
        - Apply sorting based on the `OrderType` enum.
        - Implement a case-insensitive filter on a search string (e.g., name or email using `contains`).

4. **🚨 Exception Handling**
    - Introduce centralized exception handling consistent with the existing `StatusDTO` standard.
    - All responses, including errors, must return HTTP status code **200**.

5. **🔐 JWT Security**
    - Integrate authentication using **JSON Web Token (JWT)**.
    - The token must be validated against:
        - **Policy**: Applicable authorization rules
        - **Issuer**: Token issuing authority
        - **Expiration**: Token validity period

6. **🐞 Bug Fixing**
    - Identify and fix any bugs in the base code.

7. **🧪 Unit Testing**
    - Add unit tests for new and modified features.
    - Ensure adequate coverage.

8. **📝 Javadoc Documentation**
    - Add **Javadoc comments** for relevant classes, methods, and attributes.
    - This improves code **readability** and **maintainability**.

## 📎 Important Notes

- 📚 **External Libraries**: Use of third-party libraries is allowed if they are **up-to-date and free from known vulnerabilities**.
- 🧱 **Architecture**: Do **not** modify the existing layered architecture of the application.

---

## ❓ Follow-up Question

> **🧠 For larger and more complex projects, why is it discouraged to use web-exposed objects (e.g., `? extends GenericRequest`, `? extends GenericResponse`) within the Service layer?**

Please include a brief answer to this question in your submission email.

## 🤖 Bonus (Optional) — AI-Assisted Development

> This task is completely optional and does not affect the base evaluation of the exercise.

Try to solve one or more of the previous tasks using an agentic AI assistant, such as:
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
- [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)
- Other similar tools (Copilot Workspace, Cursor, etc.)

### 📁 What to Submit

Add an `/ai-assisted/` folder to your repository containing one or more Markdown files documenting the experience. The files should cover the following aspects:

#### 1. `pre-analysis.md` — Pre-Exercise Analysis
- How you presented the project context to the AI (repository, README, existing code)
- What information you provided before starting
- Any limitations encountered in the tool's initial understanding of the codebase

#### 2. `plan.md` — Change Plan
- The intervention plan generated or co-built with the AI
- How you iterated on the plan (refinement prompts, corrections, intermediate steps)
- Which tasks you fully delegated to the AI and which you handled manually

#### 3. `report.md` — Final Report
- **Key prompts used**: summary or excerpt of the most significant prompts
- **Difficulties encountered**: generated errors, hallucinations, code that failed to compile, lost context
- **Approaches adopted**: how you guided the tool toward the correct solution
- **Personal assessment**: how much did it speed up your work? Where did it fall short?

### 📌 Notes
- The AI is not required to have completed the tasks correctly — the goal is to document the *process*, not the outcome.
- Honest criticism is appreciated: a report that describes the tool's failures is more valuable than one that only highlights its successes.
- If you used multiple tools, you may create separate subfolders (`/ai-assisted/claude-code/`, `/ai-assisted/gemini-cli/`, etc.)
